# NODE.JS TYPESCRIPT API - S.O.L.I.D.

Simple API made with Node.JS using Typescript to understand the concepts of S.O.L.I.D.

## FUNCTIONALITIES

This API sends emails (using nodemailer and MailTrap) and """stores""" created users.

### DISCLAIMER

This API was **not** done by me. I followed and copied a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAV4Vy4jfkc).
The reason I am uploading this to my github is so I can check this code later if I need it.
